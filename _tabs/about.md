# ðŸ‘‹ Hi!

I'm Niels, a security specialist with a passion for learning and helping organisations enhance their digital defences. Holding the OSCP, OSWP, and Security+ certifications, I thrive on problem-solving and love working on CTFs and other cybersecurity-related challenges. With a commitment to lifelong learning, I stay informed of cybersecurity trends and enjoy interacting with fellow professionals to make the digital world safer.

On this blog, I will be publishing research, write-ups, and other technology-related projects to teach others, as well as to facilitate my own learning along the way.
